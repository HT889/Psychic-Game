# Psychic-Game

# What this is?

A letter guessing game, press a key to guess a letter that the computer has chosen at random. You get 10 guesses before acquiring a LOSS. If you guess correctly, you get a WIN. If you get a WIN or a LOSS, your amount of guesses resets and the game starts over.

# Why this project is useful:

It's helping me practice javascript. Other than that, it's pretty pointless. :P
